# 英文大陸台灣計算機術語對照表
I'm from Taiwan, new to [GitHub](https://github.com/), and get a lot of exposure to computer science on the Internet. I found that due to cultural differences, the terminologies of computer science in China are much different from that in Taiwan. It has no different when reading English. However, recently, the teaching contents of computer science in [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) of China have become much more, but because of the difference in terminologies, it is daunting to study. Therefore, I searched the relevant webpage and found that [GitHub](https://github.com/) does not have a comparison table of terminologies of computer science in China and Taiwan, but there are some in [wikibooks](https://zh.wikibooks.org/zh-tw/%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E6%9C%AF%E8%AF%AD%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%A8), but all of them are in traditional Chinese, and all of the terminologies of China are not in simplified Chinese, and there are some errors in the content; for example, *Smartphone* in China is not called *智慧型手机*, instead, is called *智能手机*, and I corrected up. However, most of the content is based on [wikibooks](https://zh.wikibooks.org/zh-tw/%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E6%9C%AF%E8%AF%AD%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%A8). I also recommend several websites for Taiwanese to compare and learn computer science terminologies of China. I will update the terminologies comparison table and website list in due course of time (If I have time, I am currently studying C++ and Python). Pull Requests are also welcome. As well as, I hope that people from other scientific fields (however, I know only people who focus on CS go to GitHub) will enlarge the content in other fields.
